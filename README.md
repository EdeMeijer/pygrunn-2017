These are the presentation slides for my talk about deep learning with TensorFlow
at PyGrunn 2017. It is based on reveal.js and has some other stuff mixed in for
animations based on mo.js.

Code quality is quite terrible, I was in a hurry.

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

Run it by running `npm start`.
